## User Interface components

We use (StoryBook)[https://storybook.js.org] to design, test and document the components.

To start developing components, run the command:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

It will host all the components exported with files of `.stories.ts` suffix inside `src/stories` directory.
Examples are in `src/stories` directory.
